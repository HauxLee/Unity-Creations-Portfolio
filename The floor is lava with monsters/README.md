# A Real-time 3D and Programming Project

This Unity project has two features:

1. A real-time 3D project, published prototype with 3D objects that have been moved and/or scaled, materials, directional light, imported assets. Complete challenge of creating a game where a ball moves along a thin platform above lava.

2. A project where scripts programmatically alter object properties.
