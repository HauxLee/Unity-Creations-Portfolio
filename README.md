# Unity Project Showcase

Welcome to Haoxuan's Unity Project Showcase. This repository is a collection of my work in game development, utilizing Unity to create a variety of projects that showcase my skills in game mechanics, interactive design, C# programming, and more.
## Overview

This portfolio includes a diverse range of Unity projects, from simple learning exercises to complex, self-developed games. Each project is stored in a separate folder within the repository, complete with its own README file detailing the projects' contents, architectures, codebases, essential files, and access to live demos.

### Learning Pathway Projects

These projects were completed as part of my learning journey with Unity Learn, following the Unity Essentials and Junior Programmer pathways. They serve as foundational exercises, helping me to solidify my understanding of Unity's core principles, including 3D and 2D game development, UI design, and scripting in C#.
