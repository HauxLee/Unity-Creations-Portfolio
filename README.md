# Unity Project Showcase

Welcome to my Unity Project Showcase! This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of the various projects I have developed using Unity. From game mechanics and UI design to script writing in C#, this collection demonstrates a wide range of skills and creativity in game development.

## Featured Project: Sokoban: Teleport Labyrinth

"Sokoban: Teleport Labyrinth" is a standout project in this repository, showcasing advanced game design, puzzle strategy, and an innovative teleportation mechanic. This project exemplifies my ability to blend traditional gameplay elements with new ideas, creating a unique and engaging player experience.

### Highlights:
- **Innovative Gameplay:** Introduces a teleportation mechanic to the classic puzzle strategy genre.
- **Challenging Puzzles:** Offers a variety of levels that test strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities.
- **Engaging Design:** Features a visually appealing 2D environment and an interactive UI.
- **Comprehensive Development:** From concept to execution, demonstrating full-cycle project development.

## Learning Pathway Projects

In addition to my personal projects, this repository includes a series of projects developed through Unity Learn's Learning Pathways, specifically within the Unity Essentials and Junior Programmer tracks. These projects were instrumental in honing my skills in Unity development, covering areas such as:

- **3D and 2D Game Development:** Creating interactive and immersive game environments.
- **Scripting in C#:** Writing clean and efficient code to control game mechanics.
- **UI Design:** Designing user interfaces that are intuitive and enhance the gaming experience.
- **Physics and Interactions:** Implementing realistic physics and interactions between game elements.

These projects, while following guided learning paths, have been essential in developing a solid foundation in Unity game development.

### Example Projects:
- **A Car Control Project:** Navigate a car on a suspended roadway, avoiding obstacles.
- **A Plane Control Project:** Pilot an airplane through obstacles with pitch control.
- **A Real-Time 2D Project:** A marble game prototype demonstrating 2D object manipulation.
- **A Real-time 3D and Programming Project:** A game where a ball navigates over lava with programmable object manipulation.
